## Importing data into PowerBi
As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model
Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.

Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.

Following Good practices of data modeling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices of https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/

In this project, we have followed the Snowfall data modeling method.
